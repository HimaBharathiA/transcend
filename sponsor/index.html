                <p class="sectionText">In the past, competitions have fallen due to an unreliable or often single funding sourceâ€”something we aim to fix!</p>

<p class="sectionText">Transcend Engineering is an already established student organization which will act as a steady home for this competition. By finding awesome sponsors like yourselves, we will grow the Madison entrepreneurial together with our students in mind (which is Transcends sole mission as an org!).</p>
